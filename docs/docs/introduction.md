# Introduction

**Create a simple REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (seriously)**

For developers that need a quick NodeJS backend for small projects.

No need for any coding, unless you want to opt-out of the defaults, or want to do more customization.

Data is kept in memory, but you can also store it in a JSON file or MongoDB database.

## Temba?

> _"Temba, at REST"_

A metaphor for the declining of a gift, from the [Star Trek - The Next Generation episode "Darmok"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temba).

In the fictional Tamarian language the word _"Temba"_ means something like _"giving"_ or _"offering"_. So I am offering you this versatile library to help you build APIs with ease.
